# ATM Application

"In this exercise, you’ll learn how to keep track of the state of an automated teller machine or ATM. An ATM is a machine that you can use to withdraw or deposit cash to your bank account. You’ll create a simple ATM with two components (the bank and the ATM) and learn how to synchronize them so that the account balance updates when cash is deposited or withdrawn"
## Installation

- Fork the project onto your local machine

- Install a local server onto your machine

- Run the local server by entering http-server -c-1 into your terminal

## Roadmap

I'm still grasping the process of styling React components. When I revisit this, I want re-format to make it asthetically pleasing for the user.
